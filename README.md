- Clone the repository : `git clone https://github.com/DianeDerycke/21sh.git

- Go to the repository : `cd ./21sh`

- Compile the project : `make`

- Run the program : `./21sh`

## Informations

### Makefile
The Makefile contains the regular rules such as :
- `make clean`
- `make fclean`
- `make re`

# Key takeaways
This project allowed me to understand how to make a lexer and a parser and the differences between severals parser's algorithms. It was really interesting to do this project, i struggled a lot with the pipeline algorithm, but at the end it allows me to improve my skills.
